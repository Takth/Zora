# Zora CSS

Front-end library. Simplicity in mind.

Zora is a CSS library written in SASS. The main idea is that Zora is super and I mean SUPER customizable and simple. It's light theme is a good solution for starting out a new project, but as the project enlarges you may need certain functions and customizability. This is Zora, a project that evolves and develops itself around and with your app, not the other way. In Zora you can change anything you want just with a few click, no searching in the code, from the color pallet to the paddings and margins, everything is contained in the theme file.
